# UV_DamageAnalysis

This is a package of 3 macros to analyse data that have been obtained from the Nikon CSU-X1 spinning disk controlled by Metamorph:

1 –macro 1 : **Crop_and_LoadROIline**  to prepare the data (read the roi line, crop images to obtain image with single nucleus …).
2- macro2 : **AlignImageSequence**  Cell move during timelapse acquisition so we have to align the image sequences.
3- macro3  for **UVdamageAnalysis** plot the kinetics curves , analyse and extract results parameters.
